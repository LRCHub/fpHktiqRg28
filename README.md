```
Woah, woah, woah
(Back when we were young
and dumb and we knew everything)
2002,
and I'm hangin' on a tour bus
Leaving my hometown, Napanee
(Bye)
Rockin' a necktie,
black eyeliner
White tank top and I'm
chasin' my dreams, yeah
Livin' like a rockstar
Trashin' hotel rooms
(Oops)
Let's get stupid tattoos
(Okay)
'Cause we've got nothin' to
lose
(Ha)
I've been thinkin' 'bout
that summer when we had
each other
Back when we were young and
dumb and we knew everything
We said this would last forever,
can't get any better
Like when we were young and
dumb and we had everything
(Woah)
These are the best nights
(Woah)
Livin' our best life
(Woah)
Like when we were young
and dumb and we knew everything
We're back again,
now it's twenty years later
(Hey, boys)
Somehow it feels like
nothing's changed
(Haha)
I'm just a kid,
still a pop-punk skater
They told me, "Get a job,
" but I said, "No way"
Livin' like a rockstar
Trashing dressing rooms
(My bad)
Smashing Fender guitars
(Woo)
'Cause we got nothin' to lose
I've been thinkin' 'bout
that summer when we had
each other
Back when we were young and
dumb and we knew everything
We said this would last forever,
can't get any better
Like when we were young and
dumb and we had everything
(Woah)
These are the best nights
(Woah)
Livin' our best life
(Woah)
Like when we were young
and dumb and we knew everything
(Woah)
These are the best nights
(Woah)
Livin' our best life
(Woah)
Like when we were young
and dumb and we knew everything
I've been thinkin' 'bout
that summer when we had
each other
Back when we were young and
dumb and we knew everything
